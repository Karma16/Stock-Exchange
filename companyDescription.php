        <h2>Alphabet Inc.(GOOG)</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Google announced a 2-for-1 stock split way back in 2012, and it finally took effect in early 2014. The result: GOOG was joined by GOOGL, each representing different classes of Google stock.</p>
        <p>While GOOGL stock allowed for voting rights, GOOG stock did not. There are two different Google stock to choose from. The big differentiator is simple: voting rights. And the motivation was obvious: to help founders stay in control.</p>
        <p>A quick summary:
        <ul>
          <li>GOOG stock represents Class C shares, while GOOGL stock represents Class A shares.</li>
          <li>Class C shares (GOOG) have no voting rights, while Class A shares (GOOGL) have one vote each.</li>
          <li>Anyone who owned Google stock before the split got one share of the voting GOOGL stock and one share of the non-voting GOOG stock.</li>
          <li>There are also Class B shares of Google stock, which do not trade in the public market, are owned by Google insiders and each get ten votes.</li>
          <li>The fine print: Every time the company sells a share of Class C stock, it also must convert one Class B share into a Class A share.</li>
          <li>Google (as the result of a class-action settlement around the stock split) will compensate non-voting GOOG stock investors in a year if there is a substantial difference in price between the two classes.</li>
          <li>Google Class A and C shares were both represented on Nasdaq OMX indices such as the Nasdaq-100 through June 20. Thus, the Nasdaq-100 actually had 101 constituents during that time.</li>
          <li>Google Class A shares stopped being listed on Nasdaq OMX indices after the quarterly rebalance on June 23, 2014, and Google instead will be represented on such indices by the Class C shares. Class A shares will continue to trade on the exchange, however.</li>
        </ul>
